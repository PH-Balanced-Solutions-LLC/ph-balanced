          <h2>Finding the right Balance</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, "AI" is out there and we're embracing it, here at PH-Balanced we lead by
            example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generative AI has had a big leap forward and it is rewarding to see how much
            it can accomplish in a short period of time. However it is not
            perfect and has limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to challenge you to take a deep dive on the generated images we created. Be critical of the output. There is a logic behind the images and
            the styles we chose and prompts we engineered.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we want you to learn from your deep dive is that if you are expecting Machine Learning, Deep learning and neural nets
            to be a magic wand to wave, change your expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the foreseeable future, AI is still very much learning and
            growing. If you are asking yourself if AI is right for you - talk to
            us first.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've been in the thick of Generative AI for a while now, and have
            our sea legs. Let us help you!
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and spoiler alert: Artificial Intelligent doesn't exist. It is a
            term of use, like "The Cloud". And no, we didn't use GPT to write
            the copy, that's all us.

          <h2>Proposing Innovative Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            In a lot of ways, innovation is a leap of faith. But let's be
            pragmatic: innovation is difficult and risky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us help you mitigate the risk of finding emerging technologies
            to use. Honestly, we may even propose some battle tested tech
            because sometimes the risk isn't worth it and comes at too high a
            cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're here to help you find the right solution at the right time and
            on budget.

          <h2>Executing on Deliverables</h2>
          <p>
            If you're still reading this, good for you! TLDR; If you can't
            execute on deliverables, you won't achieve success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step is to define what success means to you and your
            organization. After that, we can find solutions to support your
            deliverables.
          </p>
          <p>
            At PH-Balanced, we don't do endless meetings and reductive
            slide-shows that don't go anywhere, or upsell you to another
            product. We want you to be successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you define what success looks like (even on a napkin) we will
            help you execute it.

          <h2>Finding the right technology</h2>
          <p>
            Vendor Assessments, Security Assessments, build vs. buy, TCO, ROI, SOC.
            It's a lot to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding the right technology is simultaneously the most trivial and
            non-trivial decision your business can make. It's a riddle, wrapped
            in an enigma, wrapped in a... well you know the quote.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have two decades of experience using technologies as consumers,
            developers, engineers, architects, security specialists and
            managers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've done everything from making small e-Commerce sites to creating
            brand new products from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're stuck, let us guide you. We can help with everything from
            RFPs to analysis.

          <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
          <p>
            Critical thinking is not about lurking on social media and then
            deciding what the next trend is by scrolling your feed and saying:
            "I want to be the next...". That rarely if ever works without a lot of capital investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            At PH-Balanced, we did the whole social media thing and we've gone
            back to basics. You're not going to find us posting to up our brand
            through click-bait. Our brand is our word, and that is something in
            short supply these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to find the spaces in between, to figure out where the
            gaps are in the market and help you find your niche that is
            sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>If we can be brilliant along the way, all the better!</p>

          <h2>Having Fun along the way</h2>
          <p>So, yeah - we got the generative AI bug... there's that.</p>
          <p>
            But can you blame us? It's just really fun! And, everyone needs to
            have some fun once in a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Running a business can be a chore and stressful beyond belief. The
            world is a funny 'ol place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal at PH-Balanced is to provide a really healhty work experience.
            The best ideas come from when we have fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every image here, the CSS and some of the coding was done with an AI
            assistant, because we wanted to see what it could do. For us,
            developing the next move was realizing that there are some really
            great tools out there.
          </p>
          <p>
            And honestly, we had to step in a few times because we knew better.
            Generative assistants still don't know how to keep one organized and
            we don't want to grant them all access in our file system yet.

          <h2>Communicating Results</h2>
          <p>
            At the core of our delivery strategy is supplying you with a way to
            communicate back to your stakeholders with honesty and conviction. We want you to know that when you speak, you can back up what you say.
          </p>
          <p>
            What drives this core is the ability to see the micro and macro
            level of engineering with a great deal of perception. And we'll
            create great documentation to that effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of our mission is a philosophy we've coined: "The Art and Zen
            of Successful Failure." or "How we learned to love it when things go
            wonk-a-doodle."
          </p>
          <p>
            Success and Failure are not spherical in nature, nor are they
            weighted all the same. They do not take up the same amount of
            volume, or have the same densities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's face it: one person's definition of success is sometimes
            another's definition of failure. We'll help you control that.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will pledge to you that we will be honest with how to proceed in
            a way were your organization can make the most out of your
            definition of success.

          <h2>Developing the next Move</h2>
          <p>
            A quick admission here - we're ok at chess, but collectively we will
            never be a champion. However, we can program the code that makes an
            AI bot that will play chess for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing the next move is still very much a human endeavor, no
            amount of programming of synapses can reach the computational level
            and experience you have right now - today - reading this with your
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing the next move within your organization will be a human
            effort. You, your staff, your stakeholders are all valuable and
            valued. We're not interested in changing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, we will always look to future technology and give it a go. It's
            only human.

          <h2>A desire to learn</h2>

            Our vision statement is this: 
          </p>
          <blockquote className="blockquote text-center"><p>You are only limited by your
          imagination, and a desire to learn.</p></blockquote>
          <p>
            Our goal is to learn everything we can about your organization, your
            mission, your culture and how you are successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            You're going to expect a lot from us, so we're going to expect a lot
            from you in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best thing about how we work, is that it shouldn't feel like
            work. Well, maybe keeping the network up, or the datacenter intact,
            or keeping bugs out of the application code, keeping funders and the
            executive team in the know, problem solving, writing
            documentation... but other than that: totally not work. Promise.
